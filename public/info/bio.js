My name is Sandy Taboo. I am a Vietnamese, non-binary (they/them), and queer artist.
I have created Taboo World as a sanctuary for art, alchemy, and self-expression.
My goal is to keep the focus on nourishing your soul while also spreading light on upcoming artists.
I especially prioritize marginalized groups because there is inequality for representation and opportunities against us.
In a world of corruption and distractions, my mission is to improve the world and myself along the way.
Thank you for visiting Taboo World.
Enter the parallel universe.
